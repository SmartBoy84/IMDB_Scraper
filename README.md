# IMDB_Scraper
Simple cheerio based scraper/API for IMDB's advanced search

The app accepts all the arguments that IMDB's advanced search is able to (I.e., minimum rating, view time, key words etc)
It is able to verify correct formatting and automatically parse the API query into the appropriate IMDB url
The app is able to scrape every piece of detail avialable on the results page (E.g., directors, stars, synopsis, metacritic, rating numbers, name, release date) and return the details in JSON format

Enjoy.
